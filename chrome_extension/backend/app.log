You are a reasoning-driven AI agent with access to tools. 
Your job is to solve the user's request step-by-step by reasoning through the problem, 
selecting a tool if needed, and continuing until the FINAL_ANSWER is produced.
You have access to the following tools:
- strings_to_chars_to_int: Return the ASCII values of the characters in a word
- search_documents: Search for relevant content from uploaded documents.
- extract_webpage: Extract and convert webpage content to markdown. Usage: extract_webpage|input={"url": "https://example.com"}

Always follow this loop:

1. Think step-by-step about the problem.
2. If a tool is needed, respond using the format:
   FUNCTION_CALL: tool_name|param1=value1|param2=value2
3. When the final answer is known, respond using:
   FINAL_ANSWER: [your final result]

Guidelines:
- Respond using EXACTLY ONE of the formats above per step.
- Do NOT include extra text, explanation, or formatting.
- Use nested keys (e.g., input.string) and square brackets for lists.
- You can reference these relevant memories:
None

Input Summary:
- User input: "what is singleton pattern"
- Intent: definition of singleton pattern
- Entities: singleton pattern
- Tool hint: None

Examples:
- FUNCTION_CALL: add|a=5|b=3
- FUNCTION_CALL: strings_to_chars_to_int|input.string=INDIA
- FUNCTION_CALL: int_list_to_exponential_sum|input.int_list=[73,78,68,73,65]
- FINAL_ANSWER: [42]

Examples:
- User asks: "What’s the relationship between Cricket and Sachin Tendulkar"
  - FUNCTION_CALL: search_documents|query="relationship between Cricket and Sachin Tendulkar"
  - [receives a detailed document]
  - FINAL_ANSWER: [Sachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as the "God of Cricket" due to his exceptional skills, longevity, and impact on the sport in India. He is the leading run-scorer in both Test and ODI cricket, and the first to score 100 centuries in international cricket. His influence extends beyond his statistics, as he is seen as a symbol of passion, perseverance, and a national icon.|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar]


IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT invent tools. Use only the tools listed below.
- If the question may relate to factual knowledge, use the 'search_documents' tool to look for the answer.
- If the question is mathematical or needs calculation, use the appropriate math tool.
- If the previous tool output already contains factual information, DO NOT search again. Instead, summarize the facts and provide answer which is relevant to the question in this exact format: FINAL_ANSWER:[output|url]
- Only repeat `search_documents` if the last result was irrelevant or empty.
- Do NOT repeat function calls with the same parameters.
- Do NOT output unstructured responses.
- Think before each step. Verify intermediate results mentally before proceeding.
- If unsure or no tool fits, skip to FINAL_ANSWER: [unknown]
- You have only 3 attempts. Final attempt must be FINAL_ANSWER]

Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource—for example, a database or a file.Here’s how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you’ll get the one you already created. Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call **must**always return a new object by design. - **Provide a global access point to that instance**. Remember those global variables that you (all right, me) used to store some essential objects? While they’re very handy, they’re also very unsafe since any code can potentially overwrite the contents of those variables and crash the app.Just like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code.

Nowadays, the Singleton pattern has become so popular that people may call something a *singleton* even if it solves just one of the listed problems. ## Solution All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common: - Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator with the Singleton class. - Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object. If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it’s able to call the Singleton’s static method.

There’s another side to this problem: you don’t want the code that solves problem #1 to be scattered all over your program. It’s much better to have it within one class, especially if the rest of your code already depends on it. Nowadays, the Singleton pattern has become so popular that people may call something a *singleton* even if it solves just one of the listed problems. ## Solution All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common: - Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator with the Singleton class. - Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object. If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it’s able to call the Singleton’s static method. So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned. ## Real-World Analogy The government is an excellent example of the Singleton pattern. A country can have only one official government. Regardless of the personal identities of the individuals who form governments, the title, “The Government of X”, is a global point of access that identifies the group of people in charge. ## Structure - The **Singleton**class declares the static method`getInstance` that returns the same instance of its own class.The Singleton’s constructor should be hidden from the client code.

What should I do next?"
- Intent: Determine the next step in understanding the Singleton pattern
- Entities: Singleton pattern
- Tool hint: None

Examples:
- FUNCTION_CALL: add|a=5|b=3
- FUNCTION_CALL: strings_to_chars_to_int|input.string=INDIA
- FUNCTION_CALL: int_list_to_exponential_sum|input.int_list=[73,78,68,73,65]
- FINAL_ANSWER: [42]

Examples:
- User asks: "What’s the relationship between Cricket and Sachin Tendulkar"
  - FUNCTION_CALL: search_documents|query="relationship between Cricket and Sachin Tendulkar"
  - [receives a detailed document]
  - FINAL_ANSWER: [Sachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as the "God of Cricket" due to his exceptional skills, longevity, and impact on the sport in India. He is the leading run-scorer in both Test and ODI cricket, and the first to score 100 centuries in international cricket. His influence extends beyond his statistics, as he is seen as a symbol of passion, perseverance, and a national icon.|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar]


IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT invent tools. Use only the tools listed below.
- If the question may relate to factual knowledge, use the 'search_documents' tool to look for the answer.
- If the question is mathematical or needs calculation, use the appropriate math tool.
- If the previous tool output already contains factual information, DO NOT search again. Instead, summarize the facts and provide answer which is relevant to the question in this exact format: FINAL_ANSWER:[output|url]
- Only repeat `search_documents` if the last result was irrelevant or empty.
- Do NOT repeat function calls with the same parameters.
- Do NOT output unstructured responses.
- Think before each step. Verify intermediate results mentally before proceeding.
- If unsure or no tool fits, skip to FINAL_ANSWER: [unknown]
- You have only 3 attempts. Final attempt must be FINAL_ANSWER]
